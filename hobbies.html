<p><p style="text-indent: 40px">Now that school is over I can relax and explore some of my hobbies. As a realtor I take my own photos for marketing purposes. I use a Canon M3 witha Canon 10-18mm wide angle lens. The only edting software I currently use is the Digital Photo Professional 4 from Canon. Recently I started exploring  open source alternative the Adobe suite. DarkTable seesms to be a nice option with plenty of feature I am learning how to use.</p>

        <h4>Video</h4><br>
<p><p style="text-indent: 40px">Video is another hobby I am exploring along side photography. My love for all things gear has fueled my appreciation for these two medias. YouTube has become part of the marketing strategies for many companies; small to large. I am exploring the option of short educational videos as a marketing tool. There is a shortage of realtors educating the cunsumer about the ins and outs of the industry.  </p>

        <h4>Skate Boarding</h4>
<p><p style="text-indent: 40px">In 2016 during my Kuwait deployment I relaized I wanted to do things I had not do in many years ( maybe over twnety) and one of those things is skateboarding. Once back home I bought a cruiser with big wheels and a large spacious deck. As a teenager I skated, however I was by far a pro, just liked the feel of riding on four small wheel and controlling the board. Skateboarding is not like ridding a bycicle, you defeneitly forget how to balance and that's where I am now. Relearning with falls but enjoying the adventure of busting my back on hard concrete.</p>
